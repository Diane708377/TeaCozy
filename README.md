# TeaCozy:
## Codecademy Ready:
### Second project submitted

## Note to the Reviewer of Codecademy:

Hello,  

My name is Diane.  

I've implemented the **Tea Cozy project** in **three** main steps:
1. First, I _built_ the webpage based on the _instructions_ and _the visual
aspect_ given in the _redline document_. Everything worked well.
2. Secondly, I _tested_ the page on different browsers.
_Compatibility issues_ arose concerning _flexbox_ with the _safari_ browser made for windows users.
3. Thirdly, I _searched_ on the web _a way to fix these issues_,
and I made the decision to incorporate vendor prefixes for some properties to fix these problems.

I put some _other comments_ in the index.html and the style.css files.

Thank you for your time and advice.

Best regards,

Diane.
